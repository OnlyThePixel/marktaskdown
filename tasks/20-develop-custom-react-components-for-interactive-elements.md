- Ensure proper TypeScript typing for markdown content

## Component Architecture

- Implement proper component composition
- Create reusable sub-components where appropriate
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Implement proper state management

# Acceptance Criteria

- All components are implemented with TypeScript
- Components have proper interfaces and type definitions
- Terminal demonstration effectively simulates CLI usage
- Code examples have proper syntax highlighting
- Markdown preview correctly visualizes task files
- Components are reusable and properly documented
- Animations enhance the user experience
