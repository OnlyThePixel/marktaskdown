title: "MCP: Initial Model Context Protocol Server Setup"

This task involves setting up the foundational HTTP server for the MarkTaskDown Model Context Protocol (MCP). This server will enable AI agents to interact with MarkTaskDown as a task management system, allowing them to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks programmatically.

**Problem Solved:**
Provides a standardized interface for AI agents to manage their tasks using MarkTaskDown, facilitating better organization, tracking, and execution of AI-driven workflows.

**Functional Requirements:**

- **FR1: HTTP Server Implementation:**
  - The system MUST implement an HTTP server.
  - The choice of web framework or library (e.g., Express.js, Fastify, or native Node.js `http` module) SHOULD prioritize being lightweight, having minimal external dependencies, and ensuring easy integration for AI agent clients.
- **FR2: Configurable Port:**
  - The server MUST listen on a network port.
  - This port MUST be configurable (e.g., via an environment variable `MTD_MCP_PORT` or a configuration file).
  - A default port (e.g., 4242) MUST be used if no specific configuration is provided.
- **FR3: Basic Liveness/Health Check Endpoint:**
  - The server MUST expose a basic GET endpoint (e.g., `/` or `/health`) that responds with a success status (e.g., HTTP 200 OK) and a simple JSON message (e.g., `{"status": "ok", "message": "MarkTaskDown MCP Server is running"}`). This allows agents or monitoring systems to confirm the server is operational.
- **FR4: Standardized API Response Format:**
  - All API endpoints (including error responses) MUST return responses in JSON format.
  - A consistent response structure SHOULD be adopted (e.g., JSend: `{"status": "success", "data": ...}` or `{"status": "error", "message": ...}`).
- **FR5: Basic Error Handling:**
  - The server MUST implement basic error handling for unrecognised routes, returning an HTTP 404 Not Found status with a JSON error message.
  - The server MUST implement a generic error handler for unhandled server-side errors, returning an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error status with a JSON error message.
- **FR6: Logging:**
  - The server SHOULD log basic operational messages, such as:
    - Server startup and the port it's listening on.
    - Incoming requests (method, path).
    - Critical errors encountered during request processing.
- **FR7: Request Content Type:**
  - The server MUST be prepared to accept `application/json` content types for request bodies where applicable (e.g., for creating or updating tasks).

**Out of Scope for this Task:**

- Implementation of any specific MarkTaskDown functionality endpoints (e.g., creating tasks, listing tasks â€“ these will be separate tasks).
- Authentication or authorization mechanisms (can be added later if deemed necessary for security).
- Complex request validation schemas (initial validation can be basic).
- API documentation generation tools (can be added later).

**Considerations for AI Agent Interaction:**

- API design should be simple and intuitive for programmatic consumption.
- Error messages should be clear and provide enough context for an agent to understand the issue.
