# MCP: Create standalone entry point

## Problem Solved

This task creates a standalone entry point for the MCP server, allowing it to be run independently from the CLI. This enables LLM applications to interact with MarkTaskDown through the Model Context Protocol using STDIO transport.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1: Entry Point Creation**

  - Create the `src/infrastructure/mcp/index.ts` file
  - Initialize and start the MCP server

- **FR2: Signal Handling**

  - Implement handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
  - Ensure graceful shutdown of the server when signals are received

- **FR3: Error Handling**

  - Implement proper error handling for server initialization
  - Log errors and exit with appropriate status codes

- **FR4: Logging**
  - Add informative log messages for server startup and shutdown
  - Log errors with sufficient detail for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details

The implementation should follow this structure (pseudocode):

```
// src/infrastructure/mcp/index.ts

// Handle process signals for graceful shutdown
Register SIGINT handler:
  Log "Shutting down MarkTaskDown MCP Server..."
  Exit process with code 0

Register SIGTERM handler:
  Log "Shutting down MarkTaskDown MCP Server..."
  Exit process with code 0

// Main function
Function main():
  Try:
    Create MarkTaskDownMcpServer
    Call server.start()
    Log "MarkTaskDown MCP Server started with STDIO transport"
  Catch error:
    Log "Error starting MarkTaskDown MCP Server: [error message]"
    Exit process with code 1

// Start the server
Call main()
```

## MCP Conventions

- The entry point should be a standalone file that can be executed directly
- The server should handle signals for graceful shutdown
- Errors should be logged and the process should exit with appropriate status codes

## Dependencies

- MarkTaskDownMcpServer from the infrastructure layer
- Node.js process and signal handling

## Testing Strategy

- Test the entry point by running it directly
- Verify that the server starts correctly
- Verify that the server shuts down gracefully when signals are received
- Verify that errors are properly logged and the process exits with the correct status code
