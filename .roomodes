Always refer to docs/README.md for the most up-to-date project requirements, architecture, and technology stack\n2. Check .gitmessage for commit format guidelines\n3. Review existing code in src/ directory to understand patterns and conventions\n\n# Development Guidelines\n1. CRITICAL: Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach - ALWAYS write tests FIRST, then implement functionality\n2. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)\n3. Always commit changes before attempting to complete a task\n4. When modifying dependencies, update both package.json AND package-lock.json in the same commit\n5. Remember to run tests after making changes to verify everything still works\n6. Include file extensions in import paths (e.g., './commands/init.js' not './commands/init') since the project uses ECMAScript modules",
