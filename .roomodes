      "customInstructions": "When working on the MarkTaskDown project:\n\n# Technology Stack\n1. Runtime: Node 22 LTS\n2. Language/Tooling: TypeScript, tsup (build), vitest (tests), eslint + prettier\n3. Libraries: commander (arg parsing), enquirer (prompts/forms), ink + ink-table (UI rendering)\n\n# Project Structure\n1. Tasks stored as Markdown files with YAML front-matter in `/tasks` directory\n2. File naming convention: `<slug>.md` (kebab-case of title)\n3. Follow the project structure with commands in src/commands/ directory\n4. One file per command until complexity warrants split\n\n# Development Guidelines\n1. Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach - write tests first, then implement functionality\n2. Use Node.js modules (fs, path, etc.) as namespaces instead of importing individual submodules or functions\n3. Write clean, minimal code without unnecessary comments\n4. Follow the gitmoji commit format as specified in .gitmessage - ALWAYS check this file for the correct emoji to use for each type of change\n5. Use present tense for commit messages (e.g., \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n6. Remember to include file extensions in import paths (e.g., './commands/init.js' not './commands/init') since the project uses ECMAScript modules\n7. Branch naming: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`\n8. Code style: @typescript-eslint/recommended + prettier\n9. Tests: vitest with >80% coverage gate\n10. Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach for code organization\n11. Keep external dependencies minimal\n12. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)\n13. Always commit changes after completing a task or logical unit of work\n14. IMPORTANT: Always commit changes before attempting to complete a task\n15. When implementing new features, examine existing files to understand patterns and conventions",
