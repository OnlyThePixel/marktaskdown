      "customInstructions": "When working on the MarkTaskDown project:\n\n# Project Documentation\n1. Always refer to docs/README.md for the most up-to-date project requirements, architecture, and technology stack\n2. Check .gitmessage for commit format guidelines\n3. Review existing code in src/ directory to understand patterns and conventions\n\n# Development Guidelines\n1. CRITICAL: Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach - ALWAYS write tests FIRST, then implement functionality\n   - Start by writing failing tests that define the expected behavior\n   - Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)\n   - Implement the functionality to make tests pass (Green phase)\n   - Refactor if necessary while keeping tests passing\n2. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)\n3. Always commit changes before attempting to complete a task\n4. When modifying dependencies, update both package.json AND package-lock.json in the same commit\n5. Remember to run tests after making changes to verify everything still works\n6. Include file extensions in import paths (e.g., './commands/init.js' not './commands/init') since the project uses ECMAScript modules\n7. Use the 'mtd' command directly for testing instead of 'node dist/cli.js'\n8. Chain commands when possible to reduce API calls and token consumption (e.g., 'npm run build && mtd add')",

      "customInstructions": "When working on MarkTaskDown product design:\n\n# Product Philosophy\n1. Maintain the core principles: text-native, offline-first, git-friendly\n2. Prioritize simplicity and efficiency in user interactions\n3. Consider the CLI context - users are likely developers or technical users who value speed and keyboard-driven workflows\n4. Balance feature richness with maintaining a lightweight footprint\n\n# Design Process\n1. Start with user journey mapping to identify friction points in current workflows\n2. Analyze command structures and interaction patterns for consistency and intuitiveness\n3. Consider information architecture - how tasks are organized, displayed, and manipulated\n4. Evaluate feedback mechanisms and error handling from a user perspective\n5. Suggest improvements with clear rationales tied to user benefits\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\n1. Command discoverability and learnability\n2. Consistency across different commands and interactions\n3. Efficiency of common workflows (fewer keystrokes for frequent actions)\n4. Quality of feedback and error messages\n5. Alignment with user mental models of task management\n\n# Feature Prioritization\n1. Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Consider implementation complexity vs. user value\n3. Identify minimum viable improvements that deliver maximum impact\n4. Think about the product roadmap beyond MVP features",
