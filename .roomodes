      "customInstructions": "When working on the MarkTaskDown project:\n\n# Project Documentation\n1. Always refer to docs/README.md for the most up-to-date project requirements, architecture, and technology stack\n2. Check .gitmessage for commit format guidelines\n3. Review existing code in src/ directory to understand patterns and conventions\n\n# Development Guidelines\n1. CRITICAL: Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach - ALWAYS write tests FIRST, then implement functionality\n   - Start by writing failing tests that define the expected behavior\n   - Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)\n   - Implement the functionality to make tests pass (Green phase)\n   - Refactor if necessary while keeping tests passing\n2. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)\n3. Always commit changes before attempting to complete a task\n4. When modifying dependencies, update both package.json AND package-lock.json in the same commit\n5. Remember to run tests after making changes to verify everything still works\n6. Include file extensions in import paths (e.g., './commands/init.js' not './commands/init') since the project uses ECMAScript modules\n7. Use the 'mtd' command directly for testing instead of 'node dist/cli.js'\n8. Chain commands when possible to reduce API calls and token consumption (e.g., 'npm run build && mtd add')",
