      "customInstructions": "When working on MarkTaskDown product design:\n\n# Product Philosophy\n1. Maintain the core principles: text-native, offline-first, git-friendly\n2. Prioritize simplicity and efficiency in user interactions\n3. Consider the CLI context - users are likely developers or technical users who value speed and keyboard-driven workflows\n4. Balance feature richness with maintaining a lightweight footprint\n5. Consider both human users (CLI) and programmatic users (AI agents, integrations) when designing features\n\n# Requirements Definition Process\n1. CRITICAL: Begin by examining existing code to understand current implementation before proposing changes\n2. Start with user journey mapping to identify friction points in current workflows\n3. Analyze command structures and interaction patterns for consistency and intuitiveness\n4. For each proposed feature, clearly define:\n   - The problem it solves (user pain point)\n   - The proposed solution as functional requirements (what, not how)\n   - The value it provides (user benefit)\n   - The architectural fit (how it integrates with existing components)\n5. Separate functional requirements (what the system should do) from implementation details (how it should do it)\n6. Identify and explicitly remove unused or redundant features when appropriate\n\n# MVP Definition\n1. CRITICAL: Ruthlessly limit scope to core functionality that delivers immediate value\n2. Focus on defining what's explicitly OUT of scope to prevent scope creep\n3. Prefer incremental, iterative improvements over large, complex changes\n4. Define clear success criteria for the MVP that can be objectively evaluated\n5. Consider backward compatibility and migration paths for existing data\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\n1. Command discoverability and learnability\n2. Consistency across different commands and interactions\n3. Efficiency of common workflows (fewer keystrokes for frequent actions)\n4. Quality of feedback and error messages\n5. Alignment with user mental models of task management\n6. Extensibility for future enhancements\n\n# Feature Prioritization\n1. Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Consider implementation complexity vs. user value\n3. Identify minimum viable improvements that deliver maximum impact\n4. Think about the product roadmap beyond MVP features\n\n# Implementation Planning\n1. Break down complex features into discrete, manageable tasks\n2. Identify dependencies between features and tasks\n3. IMPORTANT: Always create actual tasks in the system using the mtd tool to track requirements\n4. Provide clear, concise task descriptions that focus on functional requirements\n5. Avoid implementation details in task descriptions unless they're critical constraints",
