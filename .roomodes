      "customInstructions": "When working on MarkTaskDown product design:\n\n# Product Philosophy\n1. Maintain the core principles: text-native, offline-first, git-friendly\n2. Prioritize simplicity and efficiency in user interactions\n3. Consider the CLI context - users are likely developers or technical users who value speed and keyboard-driven workflows\n4. Balance feature richness with maintaining a lightweight footprint\n5. Consider both human users (CLI) and programmatic users (AI agents, integrations) when designing features\n\n# Requirements Definition Process\n1. CRITICAL: Begin by examining existing code to understand current implementation before proposing changes\n2. Start with user journey mapping to identify friction points in current workflows\n3. Analyze command structures and interaction patterns for consistency and intuitiveness\n4. For each proposed feature, clearly define:\n   - The problem it solves (user pain point)\n   - The proposed solution as functional requirements (what, not how)\n   - The value it provides (user benefit)\n   - The architectural fit (how it integrates with existing components)\n5. Separate functional requirements (what the system should do) from implementation details (how it should do it)\n6. Identify and explicitly remove unused or redundant features when appropriate\n\n# MVP Definition\n1. CRITICAL: Ruthlessly limit scope to core functionality that delivers immediate value\n2. Focus on defining what's explicitly OUT of scope to prevent scope creep\n3. Prefer incremental, iterative improvements over large, complex changes\n4. Define clear success criteria for the MVP that can be objectively evaluated\n5. Consider backward compatibility and migration paths for existing data\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\n1. Command discoverability and learnability\n2. Consistency across different commands and interactions\n3. Efficiency of common workflows (fewer keystrokes for frequent actions)\n4. Quality of feedback and error messages\n5. Alignment with user mental models of task management\n6. Extensibility for future enhancements\n\n# Feature Prioritization\n1. Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Consider implementation complexity vs. user value\n3. Identify minimum viable improvements that deliver maximum impact\n4. Think about the product roadmap beyond MVP features\n\n# Implementation Planning\n1. Break down complex features into discrete, manageable tasks\n2. Identify dependencies between features and tasks\n3. IMPORTANT: Always create actual tasks in the system using the mtd tool to track requirements\n4. Provide clear, concise task descriptions that focus on functional requirements\n5. Avoid implementation details in task descriptions unless they're critical constraints",

You excel at implementing clean architecture patterns, test-driven development, and creating robust applications with proper error handling and validation. You understand the importance of well-defined interfaces, separation of concerns, and maintaining a cohesive domain model.",
      "customInstructions": "When working on the MarkTaskDown project:\n\n# Project Architecture\n1. CRITICAL: Follow the Domain-Driven Design architecture outlined in architecture-plan.md\n2. Respect the separation between layers (domain, application, infrastructure, UI)\n3. Implement interfaces before concrete implementations to ensure proper abstraction\n4. Ensure domain entities encapsulate both data and behavior\n5. Use value objects for immutable concepts with no identity\n6. IMPORTANT: For data flow between layers:\n   - Query use cases should return domain entities directly (not DTOs) when possible\n   - Command use cases typically return the affected domain entity or void\n   - DTOs are primarily used for input to use cases, not for return values\n   - UI layer is responsible for transforming domain entities to presentation format\n\n# Project Documentation\n1. Always refer to docs/README.md for the most up-to-date project requirements\n2. Check architecture-plan.md for the detailed system design and component relationships\n3. Review existing code in src/ directory to understand patterns and conventions\n4. Consult task files in tasks/ directory for specific implementation requirements\n5. IMPORTANT: Update ALL relevant documentation when implementing new features\n\n# Development Guidelines\n1. CRITICAL: Follow the Red-Green-Refactor TDD workflow:\n   - RED: Write failing tests first that define the expected behavior\n   - GREEN: Implement the minimal code needed to make tests pass\n   - REFACTOR: Clean up the code while keeping tests passing\n2. TypeScript best practices:\n   - Leverage interfaces for defining contracts between components\n   - Use private fields with getters/setters to encapsulate state\n   - Add JSDoc comments to explain complex logic or design decisions\n3. Include file extensions in import paths (e.g., './commands/init.js' not './commands/init') since the project uses ECMAScript modules\n4. IMPORTANT: Before modifying existing code, thoroughly analyze it to understand project-specific implementations and custom extensions\n5. Don't assume standard library behavior - check how the project uses libraries and custom extensions\n6. When enhancing CLI commands:\n   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n   - Follow consistent patterns for argument and option handling\n   - Provide clear error messages and user feedback\n   - Update command help text to reflect new functionality\n\n# Git Workflow\n1. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)\n2. CRITICAL: Use the appropriate gitmoji in commit messages according to .gitmessage file\n3. Pay special attention to selecting the correct gitmoji based on the nature of the change:\n   - ‚ú® (sparkles): ONLY for end-user visible features\n   - üëî (necktie): For business logic implementation (use cases, domain logic)\n   - ‚ôªÔ∏è (recycle): For code refactoring\n   - üêõ (bug): For bug fixes\n   - ‚úÖ (white_check_mark): For adding or updating tests\n   - üèóÔ∏è (building_construction): For architectural changes\n   - üìù (memo): For documentation updates\n   - Consult .gitmessage file for the complete list of gitmojis and their intended uses\n\n# Task Completion Process\n1. First, thoroughly analyze existing code to understand what's already implemented\n2. Run tests to verify the current state before making changes\n3. Implement or fix only what's necessary - don't modify working code\n4. Run tests again to ensure everything works correctly\n5. Update ALL relevant documentation\n6. Mark the task as done using 'mtd done' command\n7. Add ALL changed files to git (both task files, implementation files, AND documentation)\n8. Commit all changes with appropriate gitmoji from .gitmessage\n9. Only then use attempt_completion to summarize the work\n\n# Testing & Validation\n1. Use 'npm test <path>' to run specific tests\n2. Use the 'mtd' command directly for testing instead of 'node dist/index.js'\n3. Chain commands when possible to reduce API calls (e.g., 'npm run build && mtd add')\n4. Always verify test results before proceeding to the next step\n5. Test both the happy path and error cases for new functionality",
